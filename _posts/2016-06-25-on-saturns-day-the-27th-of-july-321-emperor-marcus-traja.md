On Saturn's Day, the 27th of July, 321, Emperor Marcus Trajan awoke from his bed with a shock."Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in the form of Sol Invictus, the Unconquerable Sun, spoke to me in a dream," he told his wife Amalthea.

That is how it began, the third Northern Crusade, in which Rome marched on the Viking and destroyed the home of their gods.
