Part One: The Siege of Valhalla 

On Saturn's Day, the 27th of July, 321, Emperor Marcus Trajan awoke with a shock. Possessed by a vision, he turned to his wife Amalthea and said, "Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in the form of Sol Invictus, the Unconquerable Sun, spoke to me in a dream. He commanded me to attack the Norsemen and invade take their lands. Then he said I should set upon the sacred tree where their gods dwell and burn it to the ground. So that our gods could consume theirs for the glory and righteousness of the Savior."

That is how it began-- the third Northern Crusade, in which Rome marched on the Viking and destroyed the home of their gods.
